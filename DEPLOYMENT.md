# Deployment Setup

This repository is configured to automatically deploy to `/var/project` on your server after GitHub Actions completes successfully.

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

1. **HOST**: Your server's IP address (e.g., `148.230.116.195`)
2. **USERNAME**: SSH username (e.g., `root`)
3. **SSH_KEY**: Your private SSH key for authentication

## How to Set Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret" and add each secret:
   - Name: `HOST`, Value: `148.230.116.195`
   - Name: `USERNAME`, Value: `root`
   - Name: `SSH_KEY`, Value: `[your private SSH key content]`

## Deployment Process

The workflow will:

1. **Build**: Install dependencies and build the customer-app
2. **Transfer**: Copy built files and deployment script to your server
3. **Deploy**: Run the deployment script on your server to:
   - Create backup of current deployment
   - Deploy new version to `/var/project`
   - Set proper permissions
   - Clean up temporary files

## Server Requirements

Your server should have:
- SSH access enabled
- Write permissions to `/var/project`
- Node.js installed (if your app requires it)
- Any web server (nginx, apache) configured to serve from `/var/project`

## Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the project locally
pnpm install
npx nx build customer-app

# Copy files to server
scp -r dist/apps/customer-app/* root@148.230.116.195:/var/project/
```

## Troubleshooting

- Check GitHub Actions logs for deployment errors
- Verify SSH key has proper permissions on the server
- Ensure `/var/project` directory exists and is writable
- Check server logs for application-specific issues
